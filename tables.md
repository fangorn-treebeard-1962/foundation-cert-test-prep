## Test Techniques
| Black Box | White Box | Experience-Based |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Test conditions, test cases, and test data are derived from a test basis that may include software requirements, specifications, use cases, and user stories | Test conditions, test cases, and test data are derived from a test basis that may include code, software architecture, detailed design, or any other source of information regarding the structure of the software | Test conditions, test cases, and test data are derived from a test basis that may include knowledge and experience of testers, developers, users and other stakeholders |
| | | |
| Test cases may be used to detect gaps between the requirements and the implementation of the requirements, as well as deviations from the requirements | |
| | | |
| Coverage is measured based on the items tested in the test basis and the technique applied to the test basis | Coverage is measured based on the items tested within a selected structure (e.g., the code or interfaces) | |
| | | |
| | Specifications are often used as an additional source of information to determine the expected outcome of test cases | |
